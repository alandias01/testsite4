You declare components, directives, and pipes inside the module you are using it in
If you wish to share the components inside this module with another module, you must export them

you import modules so you can use the components inside that module
You dont have to declare the components of that module, but they have to be in the exports
of the module they are contained in

If you have a module like commonModule and formsModule that are commonly used in many modules, 
you can contain them in a shared module.  You just put them in the exports.  You don't have to put 
them in imports unless you are going to use them inside the shared module.

If you have a component you want to share, you can create it in the shared module, then put it in 
declarations and exports
